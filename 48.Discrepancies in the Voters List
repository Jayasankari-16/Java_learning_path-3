/* As you might remember, the collector of Siruseri had ordered a complete revision of the Voters List. 
He knew that constructing the list of voters is a difficult task, prone to errors.
Some voters may have been away on vacation, others may have moved during the enrollment and so on.
To be as accurate as possible, he entrusted the task to three different officials.
Each of them was to independently record the list of voters and send it to the collector.
In Siruseri, every one has a ID number and the list would only list the ID numbers of the voters and not their names.
The officials were expected to arrange the ID numbers in ascending order in their lists.
Voter ID numbers are unique and not duplicated in any lists.*/
