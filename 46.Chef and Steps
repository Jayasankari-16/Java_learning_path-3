/* In order to establish dominance amongst his friends, Chef has decided that he will only walk in large steps of length exactly K feet.
However, this has presented many problems in Chefâ€™s life because there are certain distances that he cannot traverse.
Eg. If his step length is 5 feet, he cannot travel a distance of 12 feet. 
Chef has a strict travel plan that he follows on most days, but now he is worried that some of those distances may become impossible to travel.
Given N distances, tell Chef which ones he cannot travel.*/
