/* Having already mastered cooking, Chef has now decided to learn how to play the guitar. 
Often while trying to play a song, Chef has to skip several strings to reach the string he has to pluck. Eg. he may have to pluck the 
1st  string and then the 6 thstring. 
This is easy in guitars with only 6 strings; However, Chef is playing a guitar with 10 6  strings.
In order to simplify his task, Chef wants you to write a program that will tell him the total number of strings he has to skip while playing his favourite song.*/
This is how guitar strings are numbered (In ascending order from right to left).
Eg. to switch from string 1 to 6, Chef would have to skip 4 strings (2,3,4,5).*/
