/* Vlad enjoys listening to music. He lives in Sam's Town.
A few days ago he had a birthday, so his parents gave him a gift: MP3-player! Vlad was the happiest man in the world! Now he can listen his favorite songs whenever he wants!
Vlad built up his own playlist. The playlist consists of N songs, each has a unique positive integer length. 
Vlad likes all the songs from his playlist, but there is a song, which he likes more than the others. It's named "Uncle Johny".*/
